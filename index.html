            <p>The biggest mistake wealthy men make is thinking their bank account is their most attractive feature. You flash cash, mention expensive purchases, and constantly reference your financial success because you believe it's what makes you valuable. In reality, it's often what makes you forgettable.</p>

                <h4>The Wallet Personality Trap</h4>
                <p>When your wealth becomes your identity, you become one-dimensional. You're not showcasing your character, intelligence, or personality—you're just showing your credit limit.</p>

                <strong>Online Dating:</strong> Profile photos with luxury items, captions about expensive trips, mentioning income/job title<br><br>
                
                <strong>Conversations:</strong> Constantly steering talk toward your financial achievements, expensive hobbies, or material possessions<br><br>
                
                <strong>Social Settings:</strong> Always picking up every check, insisting on the most expensive options, showing off purchases</p>
